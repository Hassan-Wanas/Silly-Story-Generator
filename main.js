/*
this comment about what was wrong with the code,
and i figered out what was the proplem,
throgh seeing the elements part in the dev-tools,
[Silly story generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Silly_story_generator)
the newStory var should be inside the funcetion,
so it re-asigned every time the button got clicked,
the (x-y-z)Item should also be inside the function,
so it changes each time the button got clicked
newStory is a string so it is immutable,
so it need to be re-defined (re-asigned) to itself,
